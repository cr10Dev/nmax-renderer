# NMAX RENDERER  
## Custom CUDA renderer to rival frameworks like OptiX, Cycles, and EEVEE (It never will, but a man can try)  

### Note: For a while it will only be able to acknowledge 3 shapes. The end goal is that it can open and render STL files, and possibly even USD files (this is unlikely).
